**Version 1.00**

* Initial Release

**Version 1.01**

* Cleaned up download archive of the backup files.

* Started providing BR version for specification in ruleset.

* Removed Kings Regular from train list (removed price essentially, had tested something and forgot to remove after), but still is a mercenary unit.

* Removed Secondary Production and Normal Primary Production (If town is established on a bonus that boosts the tile's primary food source then the town receives that food production as a primary production, e.g. Grain Bonus on a plain tile will enable the titles primary production of grain for that town).

* Increased free-colonist growth to 300 food.

* Replaced Ore with furs for Arctic tile.

* Added a increase of Trade Goods of 1 (per custom house theoretically) that occurs after Independence (Needs testing as its in the events and haven't been able to play into Independence yet).

* Trade Nation-Type now increases Trade Good production by 1 (For a total of 3 per custom house after independence).

* Both Grain and Meat can be found together in most titles balanced based on title e.g. Meat will still be higher in forests and grain will be minimal or near it pending title and vice versa for plains/grasslands/etc. The bonus possibilities also reflect this of course.

* Native Converts can be trained into a free-colonist/expert by a expert, while free colonists can become a Native Convert by being trained by one (In real life some frontiersmen would meet, learn, and adopt native lifestyles).

*Native Converts now use brave images where they can (handled by the graphics mod part).

*Native Converts now can equip guns,tools, etc. in addition to them being able build colonies (which they've had sense initial release).

* Building Nation-Type now produces 2 additional tools along with its hammers.

* Agriculture Nation-Type now has the meat bonus of 2 instead of Russians and additionally start with the expertHunter in the soldier role.

* Immigration Nation-Type now has the firebrand preacher in the pioneer role.

* Naval Nation-Type now starts with a frigate instead of a merchantman.


**Version 1.02**

* Fixed the Native Converts not showing up by suppling the default brave,pioneer,etc images to graphics mod. (Had thought it would fall to default stuff but guess not).

* Fixed it so that Native Converts can actually equip now, thought I had already did that but it appears that I in fact didn't.

* Cooperation Nation-Type now starts with a Native Convert in the soldier position.

* All starting soldier positions are now equipped as dragoons.
